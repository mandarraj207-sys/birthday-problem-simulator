# Birthday Problem Simulator

## What this project does
Simulates the birthday paradox to estimate the probability that at least two people
in a group share the same birthday.

## Motivation
Built to develop intuition for probabilistic phenomena that are counterintuitive
in theory but clear through simulation.

## Approach
- Randomly generate birthdays
- Repeat experiments multiple times
- Estimate empirical probability

## Possible extensions
- Compare with analytical probability
- Plot convergence vs number of trials
